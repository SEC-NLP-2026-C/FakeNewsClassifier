🚀 Fake News Classifier Project 📰

I developed a Fake News Classifier leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a Multinomial Naive Bayes machine learning model. The classifier uses the NLTK package for efficient text preprocessing, including tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal. The project implements the Bag of Words (BoW) concept for vectorization and employs scikit-learn for model training.

🔍 Key Features:
- Utilized NLTK for text preprocessing to clean and prepare the data.
- Implemented Bag of Words for converting text data into numerical features.
- Built and trained a Multinomial Naive Bayes model using scikit-learn for accurate classification.
- Achieved 85% accuracy, demonstrating reliable performance in detecting fake news.
